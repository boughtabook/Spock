<p>Personal Information Name: Meagan Sharman</p>
<p>Student number: s3905319</p>
<p>Student email address:&nbsp; <a href="mailto:s3905319@student.rmit.edu.au">s3905319@student.rmit.edu.au</a></p>
<p>My name is Meagan Sharman, and I was born in Australia in country Victoria. My parents moved to Melbourne when I was 7 and I attended primary and secondary school in Pascoe Vale. Currently I live in regional Victoria in a house with a very large garden, some chickens, two dogs and two cats.</p>
<p>I have been working for a trade union for teachers and support staff in non-government education for 25 years as an administration assistant. I completed my HSC and commenced my working career in a variety of offices varying from an insurance company to banking and trade unions.</p>
<p>My formal education training was the completion of my High School Certificate. I have no further formal education due to working full time, I have not had the time to take on any further study because of my busy workload and many varied hobbies.</p>
<p>I have been actively involved in many community groups since 2010 in the town where I live including the local arts group and craft groups. I have been playing ukulele in a group of about 30 players for about two years and have just started to learn to play the guitar. I have a keen interest in drawing and watercolor painting and reading very long series of fantasy novels.</p>
<p>In 2017 I suffered a ruptured brain aneurysm and had to have brain surgery to have a coil inserted into the aneurysm. I took many months off work and have returned to work part time in the last year or so. I still suffer from fatigue and have some memory issues but overall, I have been very lucky and have regular MRIs at the Royal Melbourne Hospital to keep an eye on a residual aneurysm that was not able to be coiled. The result of my last scan in December 2020 indicates all is stable.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Interest in IT</span></p>
<p>My interest in IT could be best illustrated by my love of the series of games created by Nintendo - The Legend of Zelda. My first introduction into the world of technology started when my parents bought the latest and greatest invention &ndash; the Atari. The first game we played was a ping pong game and I was instantly fascinated by how you could move things on the screen by pushing buttons. My interest deepened with every game that was developed, for the Atari and then progressed to playing my brother's Commodore 64 and then onto playing role-playing games on the PC DOS. I discovered a game called King's Quest. I was then determined to play every game that Sierra released in the King Quest series and then moved onto Leisure Suit Larry and then onto the most magical but flawed Phantasmagoria.</p>
<p>My interest in studying at RMIT came about when I was browsing Open Universities for an online technology course that would upskill my classification at work. RMIT was the University that was offering the course I thought would have the best pathway into a technology degree and the advantage would be to do this through online learning.</p>
<p>In studying at RMIT I am expecting to firstly start with the basics of technology and then learn how to communicate this knowledge to others. Through my assignments, my writing skills will improve, and I will learn how to study online through the RMIT portal and also work professionally with other technology students in groups and on various projects. Ideal job My ideal job is to work in the industry in IT support. The job listing that I have chosen is one that was advertised recently by the company I work for and if I had the appropriate technology qualification, I would be in a position to apply for it with a chance of being successful.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personal profile 16 Personalities Test Mediator INFP-T summary and interpretation of results</span></p>
<p>On the outside, Mediators (INFPs) may seem quiet or even shy. But they often have vibrant, passionate inner lives. Because they make up such a small portion of the population, people with this personality type may sometimes feel misunderstood or out of step with the world. Fortunately, their caring nature can help them create and sustain deep relationships with their loved ones.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Big Five Test</span></p>
<p>You are low in openness to experience. You are very analytical and can think quickly to solve any problem you are faced with. You are an introvert. Others would describe you as very detail oriented. You listen more than you speak and are thoughtful about whatever you say. In stressful situations, you always seem calm and level-headed. You scored low in neuroticism. You are very emotionally stable. You scored low on conscientiousness. You can be a procrastinator, and you sometimes tend to put off your responsibilities until the last minute. You scored medium in agreeableness. You are a generous person and enjoy doing what you can to help others. Online learning style test You are a Visual learner! If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning. Have your eyesight checked on a regular basis. Use flashcards to learn new words. Try to visualize things that you hear or things that are read to you. Write down key words, ideas, or instructions. Draw pictures to help explain new concepts and then explain the pictures. Color code things. Avoid distractions during study times. Remember that you need to see things, not just hear things, to learn well.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Results</span></p>
<p>These test results show that I am an introverted visual learner who likes to mediate in groups and is analytical. I am caring and thoughtful and tend to listen more than speak. I am generous and enjoy helping others and am calm in stressful situations. I tend to procrastinate and will likely put things off to the last minute and need to learn not to get distracted during busy periods of my life. My behaviour in a team will be agreeable but would not lean towards leadership. I am caring of others needs and want to help as much as possible. I will listen and be thoughtful in my responses. I am a visual learner so will need new concepts explained by seeing pictures and videos which &lsquo;show&rsquo; me how to learn new things and how to go about tasks. I would best work in a team with a balanced mixture of members with leadership and extroverted qualities. I will thrive in a team if I feel that I am contributing to the team and will go out of my way to mediate problems between team members and be calm in these situations.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Idea</span></p>
<p>My project is the development of an application for the iPad which will train people to be ambidextrous. This application would be beneficial for people who have had acquired brain injuries or have RSI injuries and their dominant hand is impaired or needs to be not used for a period of time. It could be used as a tool for elderly people with little use of their hands and be an instrument that would help in learning to use the iPad. My focus on the application would be its use of the touch screen and it could have an add on of an Apple Pencil or other applicable stylus and a keyboard.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Motivation</span></p>
<p>As someone who has experienced an acquired brain injury where I developed a weakness and lost some function to the left side of my body, my motivation in developing an iPad application is in helping people that are in rehabilitation after a stroke or brain injury to develop their co-ordination in both hands, particularly the use of the non-dominant hand if the dominant hand has been impacted by this. It would be of use to people who have RSI in their dominant hand and would give them time for their other hand to rest and recover. An estimated 27,428 Australians experienced stroke for the first time in their lives in 2020, and there were an estimated 445,087 survivors of stroke living in the community - https://strokefoundation.org.au/ In 2006 nearly half a million people in the UK suffered from some form of RSI. The problem is increasing principally through the intensive use of computers and other technology that involves large amounts of keyboarding. Posture related health problems are also growing due to the sedentary nature of many jobs. - <a href="http://www.rsi.org.uk/">http://www.rsi.org.uk/</a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description</span></p>
<p><u>Description</u></p>
<p>Most people have access to an iPad. An iPad is user friendly and has become an alternative for people to using a laptop. An iPad is compatible with a keyboard, trackpad and Apple pencil but the main use I am interested in is the touch feature.</p>
<p>My intention for the ambidextrous software is a game-based program that would use the touch-based interface of the iPad for users who would go through a series of exercises that would strengthen the use of their non-dominant hand.</p>
<p>Suggestions for the exercises could be using the non-dominant hand to color in pictures or to follow lines and shapes. There could be games where the user must complete a maze or to practice quick touch exercises in a certain timeframe. Not only will these exercises help to increase the use of the hand that is impaired it will also improve eye brain co-ordination.</p>
<p>I am also interested in adding features such as learning to draw which could include items such as basic stick figures, mandalas to landscapes and building. The sky is the limit regarding different game play activities. You could include sudoku puzzles, card playing games and even go so far as to have an activity where you learn musical notes by tracing different patterns on the screen. In game videos could be included which would illustrate different finger exercises that not only relieve stress but train your brain at the same time.</p>
<p>Reminders could be part of the daily activities. These would include reminders such as getting up and moving more often, drinking water, meditation times and rest times.</p>
<p>Setting up a profile at the start of the program with a customisable avatar could include all the user&rsquo;s health issues and their rehabilitation goals.&nbsp; This could then be used to track the benefits of different activities on the application over time.</p>
<p><u>Tools and Technologies</u></p>
<p>To develop IOS applications you need a MacIntosh computer and XCode which is the official development platform for Apple. You also need to use the Swift programming language. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to design games for both IOS and android you can use third party applications such as Unity and Corona SDK.</p>
<p>To put your applications up for sale you have to have a developer&rsquo;s license and you need to join Apple&rsquo;s developer program which costs $99 per year. You also require a developer&rsquo;s certificate.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Skills Required</u></p>
<p>The skills required include knowing how to use a Mac and you also need to learn the Swift programming language. It would also be beneficial to be able to use a 3D graphic program like Unity. These are all readily available to download online with Swift being a free download. Learning new software requires time and patience to learn but it is all feasible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research would also be useful. I would need have input from medical professionals who are experienced in the methods used for the rehabilitation of stroke and RSI patients. This would be to find out if the project would be at all beneficial to patients medically or would just be for entertainment purposes and any physical benefits would be an add on side effect.</p>
<p><u>Outcome</u></p>
<p>If the project is successful it will help people. It could be used with a variety of other rehabilitation tools for patients experiencing the debilitating effects of stroke and also with patients with other impairments.</p>
<p>The iPad is user friendly and easily accessible and could be funded by government as an add on to existing rehabilitation tools.</p>
<p>The program could be expanded to include patients with mental health issues or patients with other chronic health conditions that need an outlet for pain.</p>
<p>My main hope for the impact of this project would be that that it helps people and improves their abilities while also being enjoyable and an outlet for their attention when their attention is often only on their disability, loss of function and pain.</p>
